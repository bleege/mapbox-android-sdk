# MapBox Android SDK

OSMDroid tests branch. Contains an android application project that renders a MapView with a demo tile provider from a MapBox URL, a marker, a location overlay, and examples of lines and drawables.

This example has been written in a procedural way, to put the different methods of the library in display as clearly as possible. All actions reside inside the onCreate method.

## To run the app from source

If you haven't done so yet, install the [Android SDK in your machine](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html).

Download the [zip](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-sdk/archive/OSMDroidTests.zip) from the repository and open the directory in Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any Java IDE of your choice.

You can also get the apk build from [here](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-sdk/blob/OSMDroidTests/bin/OSMDroidTests.apk?raw=true)! To install it, from your terminal use the adb tool that came with the Android sdk

    adb install path/to/OSMDroidTests.apk
